    "After researching the JSON API offered by Open Food Fact, it seems that its use is limited to specific cases, such as the development of a mobile application, where a request corresponds to a real user. Indeed, the API only allows one call for a single user request, and automated requests are not supported. In our case, where we want to enrich our database, Open Food Fact provides a database that is regularly updated and can be downloaded directly from their website. They don't recommend scraping the API to get the full data set."
